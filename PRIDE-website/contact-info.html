			Hi! My name is Anna Swanson, and I am a rising senior at Parker. As someone who has gone through a self-discovery journey and identified my sexuality, I understand the struggles of finding a sense of identity. I was honored to serve as a Pride Head last year and loved working with the community to create inclusive spaces for all members. With my previous experience, I am confident in my ability to lead and contribute to building a solid and welcoming community for LGBTQ+ students and allies. I aim to foster a safe and supportive environment where everyone feels accepted and celebrated for who they are. I am excited to serve as a Pride Head once again and contribute to the growth of our community. </p>

			My name is Gabby Druger and I'm currently a Junior, soon to be Senior. I have been actively involved with Parker's Pride groups since 6th grade, and have been a Pride Committee head since my freshman year. I'm thrilled to be serving as a Pride head for the fourth year in a row. My top priority is to break down stigmas surrounding sexuality and sexual health within the committee, and provide people with the resources and space they need to explore their own identities. This year, I plan to focus less on trying to attract new members and more on addressing the needs of those who are already involved in Pride. I'm excited to bring new ideas to the table and make a positive impact within the community. </p>

			Hi, my name is Elise Allen-Study and I’m a rising senior. I’m on both the track and cross country teams at Parker and one of the cross country captains for the 2023 season. I have been a member of the Commitee for two years in a row and have leadership experience through sports. As a member of the LGBTQIA+ community, I felt very safe coming out to my friends and classmates. During my time at Parker, I have learned so much about myself and owe it to the sense of community at the school. I would love to help this community grow even stronger. I want to make sure others feel as welcomed as I did and make sure the school continues to be a safe place for all students no matter how they identify.  </p>

			Hi I’m Amy O’Brien; I’m a rising junior. I love to play soccer and volleyball, sing and be in the musical! I really care a lot about the people at this school and think everybody deserves to have their voice heard and feel like they matter as a part of the student body.  And I believe that creating a safe and fun place for lgbtq+ people is something Parker needs. </p>
